## About us
Based in Perth, Western Australia, Seven SigmaBusiness Solutions is a Management Consultancy with formidable technical ICT knowhow. 

Our company has a proud tradition of mentoring citizen developers & young people, with 50% of our employees under the age of 30, many of which are not "traditional" developers, and 50% of our employees identifying as women/nonbinary.

Every day we partner with businesses and ambitious thinkers to help them clarify their goals, and de-risk the development of apps that bring real improvements quickly.

Few IT consultancies can lay claim to facilitating the deliberations of boards of directors, local community groups, inter-discipline groups on forums as diverse as city planning, sustainability, product envisioning and community based enquiry by design. Equally few facilitators and management consultancies can lay claim to developing and delivering high-value IT design, information architecture and delivery services either.

Seven Sigma can make this claim and have the runs on the board to prove it.

We have deep knowledge and experience in the Microsoft cloud ecosystem, specialising in the Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, Power BI and more), Microsoft 365 (MS Teams, SharePoint Online, MS Planner and more). We were the first consultancy in Australia to recognise thepotential of the Power Platform, and now enjoy the confidence of Microsoft, as we manage and advise some of the largest enterprise Office365/Power Platform deployments in AsiaPac.

Microsoft regularly calls on Seven Sigma to assist in the engagement of potential clients not only due to our expertise in the MS Power Platform but also our experience in the Governance, Safety, Risk Management, & Knowledge Management areas.Not only do we have public case studies with very large organisations and projects, Microsoft is also a customer of Seven Sigma, contracting us to provide various governance support services to them.Our highly skilled team includes the only two Microsoft Business Application MVPs and the only Fast Track Recognised Solution Architect for Power Platform in Western Australia(in fact 1 of only 27 in the world to attain this recognition). This gives us unparalleled access to Microsoft product team, strategic roadmap, and private previews. We even directly influence Microsoftâ€™s product directionon behalf of clients.
